If your research has lead to port-Hamiltonian models that may be relevant for this collection, we would be happy to include them. If you wish to contribute to the project directly, please consult our Contribution page, fork our Git repository and issue a pull request. Alternatively, feel free to contact us via e-mail to discuss our potential collaboration. We are happy to receive reference implementations in other languages and reimplement them in Julia for this package.","category":"page"}]
